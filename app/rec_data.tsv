0	Worm	https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/	A very dark and original superhero story. Taylor Hebert, a bullied high school student with the ability to control bugs, finds herself dragged into a life of supervillainy despite her desire to be a good guy. She's scarily good at it.	0	Absolutely fantastic. Highlights include excellent worldbuilding, really cool and original superpowers, and characters that actually behave intelligently instead of just doing what the author needs them to to further the plot. Only minor flaw is a bit of a rough patch about 2/3 of the way through, but if you get that far you should already be hooked enough to bear with it.	1680000	John "Wildbow" McCrae	Yes	Dark	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm
1	Harry Potter and the Natural 20	https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20	Milo, a wizard from a D&D world with a talent for munchkining, finds himself pulled into the Harry Potter universe.	1	Exciting, surprisingly touching at times, and above all one of the funniest things I've ever read. The one downside is that it seems to be abandoned. If getting closure is important to you you might want to stop at the end of the first book.	300000	David "SirPoley" Bayless	No	Mostly goofy, with some serious parts	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20
2	The Cambist and Lord Iron	http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/	Olaf Neddelsohn lives a simple life running the currency exchange desk at the Post Office, until one day the powerful and decadent Lord Iron comes demanding a fair exchange rate on a currency nobody has ever heard of before.	1	I really enjoyed this story for reasons that are hard to express. It's well written and very original, and I like the use of economics as a central theme.	9000	Daniel Abraham	Yes	Mostly serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCambistAndLordIron
3	Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality	http://hpmor.com/	Petunia Evans marries an Oxford professor instead of Vernon Dursley, and Harry is raised by loving parents with an appreciation for science and critical thinking.	1	I loved it, but it can admittedly get kind of lecturey at times so if you don't agree with the author's views on rationality, transhumanism and so on you might find that a little annoying. I would recommend giving it a try anyway.	661619	Eliezer Yudkowsky	Yes	Varies between goofy and fairly dark.	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality
4	Twig	https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-1-taking-root/1-01/	A world in which the 19th Century's advances in steam, steel, and electricity are overshadowed by even greater progress in life sciences and bioengineering. The protagonists are a band of children engineered by the Academy in various ways to serve its interests and track down dissidents and rogue experiments.	1	Brilliant worldbuilding, as one expects from Wildbow, combined with compelling characters and an engrossing plot.	1300000	John "Wildbow" McCrae	No	Mostly serious to dark, with some lighter bits.	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twig
5	The Metropolitan Man	http://rationalfiction.io/story/the-metropolitan-man	"The year is 1934, and Superman has arrived in Metropolis. Features Lex Luthor as the villain protagonist as he comes to grips with the arrival of an alien god."	2	Really nice twist on the classic setup. Special mention for how good a job it does making Luthor's character and motivations sympathetic without making him a good guy.	79000	Alexander Wales	Yes	Mostly serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMetropolitanMan
6	Pact	https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/	When Blake Thorburn inherits his grandmother's house, he discovers he has also inherited the enemies and bad karma his ancestors have accumulated as the town's resident diabolists. Now he has to learn to navigate the world of magic, spirits, and demons in the hopes of paying off as much of his family's karmic debts as possible before the unpleasant demise everyone seems sure is coming for him.	2	It's not Worm but then, what is? Some pacing issues (as in it thunders along at breakneck speed with no chance to catch your breath), but great worldbuilding and memorable characters make Pact a worthwhile read.	948800	John "Wildbow" McCrae	Yes	Serious to dark	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pact
7	The Zombie Knight	http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html	After trying to kill himself, Hector Goffe finds himself talking to a grim reaper who introduces himself as Garovel. Garovel offers Hector a deal: immortality and power beyond that of any mortal human. In exchange, Hector will be Garovel's servant, acting in the world in ways a reaper alone cannot.	2	Well written action scenes, relatable characters, and an engrossing plot. Setting is interesting although there are a few odd choices made there. Overall highly enjoyable.	400000	George M. Frost	No	Mostly serious to dark, with some lighter bits.	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight
8	Scott Alexander's short stories	https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdG34diZvALg5tgHDkvLkGg3arHy11xG6E3GGzYBeTwca	A bunch of different stories, all highly creative and unique.	2	Quality varies somewhat between stories but all of them are pretty good and some are fantastic.	70000	Scott Alexander	Yes	Goofy throughout, but many stories manage to be kind of dark at the same time.	
9	Ra	http://qntm.org/ra	"Magic is real. Discovered in the 1970s, magic is now a bona fide field of engineering. There's magic in heavy industry and magic in your home. It's what's next after electricity. Student mage Laura Ferno has designs on the future: her mother died trying to reach space using magic, and Laura wants to succeed where she failed. But first, she has to work out what went wrong. And who her mother really was."	3	Cool setting with a lot of twists. Especially recommended if you like mysteries more exotic than "who committed this crime".	150000	Sam "qntm" Hughes	Yes	Serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ra
10	Shadows of the Limelight	http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/	"This is a world where fame grants powers. Dominic de Luca was a thief and a liar before entering into the apprenticeship of Welexi Whitespear, the greatest hero of modern times. Now he must navigate the world of the Illustrati, the famous and the infamous, as he tries to secure for himself a place among the gods."	3	A really creative setting, solidly written. I enjoyed it.	100000	Alexander Wales	Yes	Serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheLimelight
11	The Last Ringbearer	http://negativesum.net/Members/hoss/misc/lastringbearer.pdf	What if The Lord of the Rings was just history as written by the victors? After Mordor's defeat in the War of the Ring, a few survivors of the Mordorean army are humanity's last hope for freedom from domination by the Elves' magic and political machinactions	3	Interesting premise and a quite solid story, although the writing style and/or the translation are imperfect in places.	150000	Kirill Yeskov, translated by Yisroel Markov	Yes	Mostly serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheLastRingbearer
12	The Jenkinsverse	https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order	Space opera on the premise that Earth is by alien standards a horrifying deathworld where only the most dangerous creatures can survive, and humans correspondingly outclass most other species physically and often mentally.	3	This is a shared universe and the quality can vary pretty widely between authors. The rating applies to the core storyline written by /u/Hambone3110.	1500000	/u/Hambone3110 and others	No	Varies between goofy and fairly dark.	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJenkinsverse
13	Floornight	http://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359	Starts with a top secret facility at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean studying the physics of souls and gets weirder from there.	4	Hard to describe in more detail than "bizarre". If you like mindbendy stuff I would definitely recommend it. Kinda like a less angsty Evangelion in a lot of ways, although a bit easier to follow what's going on.	70000	Rob "Nostalgebraist" Nost	Yes	Bizarre	
14	The Northern Caves	http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522	"An online message board devoted to a cult fantasy author wrestles with his baffling final book."	4	On a micro level really well written and engaging, but when I got to the end I didn't feel like it had really done much for me as a whole.	50000	Rob "Nostalgebraist" Nost	Yes	Mindbendy/existential horror	
15	Prelude to After the Hero	http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/after_the_hero/prelude/prelude_introduction	The chosen Hero leads his army on a long journey to attack the hidden fortress of the sinister Galavar. In the aftermath of the battle, a council meets to determine the future of the world.	4	A weird mix of interesting, creative story with some classic signs of amateur fantasy writing (e.g. too many made up words). Despite the flaws I enjoyed it.	70000	Joshua P. Fredman	Yes	Mostly serious	
16	The Arithmancer	https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer	HP fanfic where Hermione is more math oriented and a bit smarter (actually smarter, not just "this character is Intelligent(tm)".)	4	Decently written and an interesting expansion of the magic system.	529129	White Squirrel	Yes	Mostly light/serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheArithmancer
17	Hell is the Absence of God	http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html	In a world where Heaven and Hell observably exist, a man struggles with his wife's death at the hands of a visiting angel.	4	Really interesting setting. I'm not really sure what I think of the story though.	11000	Ted Chiang	Yes	Dark, but mostly in a philosophical way	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedChiang
18	Mother of Learning	https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning	"Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog's day' style setup in a fantasy world."	5	I liked it overall. The prose style and especially the dialogue can be pretty awkward at times, but the setting, characters, and especially the plot were interesting enough to keep me hooked.	350000	nobody103	No	Mostly serious	http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning
19	Evil God Average	https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.com/index/evil-god-average/	A bored deity sends a teenage girl from Earth to an RPG style fantasy world -- and puts a cruel twist on her wish for a more "average" appearance.	5	It's an amateur translation, and it shows, but it's still an interesting story.	80000	Kitaseno Yunaki, translated by Estelion	Yes	Mostly goofy	
20	Time Braid	https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid	Naruto fanfic focusing on Sakura, based on a Groundhog loop during the Chunin Exams.	5	Entertaining and reasonably well put together. Some bits get kinda porny but if you can overlook (or enjoy) that it's a solid read.	200000	ShaperV	Yes	Varies between goofy and dark.
